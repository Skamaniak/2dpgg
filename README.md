# 2dpgg
2dpgg stands for 2D procedurally generated game.
This is a simple project I use to learn about procedurally generated games so it is going to be full of inefficient, ugly and sub-optimal code.
It is not meant to be a finished and polished game but rather a learning by doing type of project.
